# Bark and Meet

**Bark and Meet** is an app that helps dog owners connect with other dog owners in their area. Designed as a social network for dog lovers, it allows users to find nearby dogs and their owners. The app includes a main "match" screen to connect compatible dogs, a chat feature, and user profiles. It was built entirely with **Flutter**, using a **Firebase NoSQL database**. This project was developed as part of a university group project with 7 members, and it received the highest grade in the entire course. My role was Scrum Master.

### Key Contributions:

- **Recommendation Algorithm**: Developed an algorithm that prioritizes nearby dogs but also incorporates additional factors, such as penalizing matches between dogs of opposite genders that could reproduce. The algorithm involves database queries and some manual parameter tuning to optimize the results.

- **Frontend OOP**: Worked closely with a teammate to design most of the classes used in the frontend, including the `User` and `Dog` classes, along with their associated methods.

- **Organizing the Team**: We followed Scrum methodology to ensure smooth development. With only 2 weeks of development time, a lot of effort went into defining the requirements, keeping everyone in sync, and distributing the workload efficiently.
